## Video demonstration


**Note:** This code and documentation assumes some experience with TypeScript and React.

## Requirements

- Node.js `v20.10.0`
- npm `v10`


## Quick start

```bash
npm install
```

## Running your Canva App

### Step 1: Start the local development server

To start the boilerplate's development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server becomes available at <http://localhost:8080>.

The app's source code is in the `src/app.tsx` file.

### Step 2: Preview the app

The local development server only exposes a JavaScript bundle, so you can't preview an app by visiting <http://localhost:8080>. You can only preview an app via the Canva editor.

To preview an app:

1. Create an app via the [Developer Portal](https://www.canva.com/developers/apps).
2. Select **App source > Development URL**.
3. In the **Development URL** field, enter the URL of the development server.
4. Click **Preview**. This opens the Canva editor (and the app) in a new tab.
5. Click **Open**. (This screen only appears when using an app for the first time.)

The app will appear in the side panel.
